# Space Invaders

A simple OpenGL-based Space Invaders game.

For simplicity and lack of resources, CPU rendering is used.

To compile:

>make

Play:

&#8592; slide left, &#8594; slide right and <kbd>Space</kbd> for fire lasers.

There are 6 alien types and 1 player type added under <shapes.h>. Please, feel free to update shapes and enjoy.

You can change window size by changing values <buffer_width> and <buffer_height> in "main" function.
